1.With ERD you have already designed on question 1, what database are you using to implement?
I'm using mongoDB to implement.
2.Why are you using that? What is the strong and weak point of it?
mongoDB makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and retrieve data when creating applications with most programming languages.
Pros:

-Is easy to set up and implement.
Cons:
-The database takes up a ton of memory.

-There is a limit of 20,000 to your max connection number.
